What is it ?
------------

This is a proof of concept over the Dual_ec_drbg backdoor from NSA. It proves that
manipulating only one of the constants is enough to predict output from PRNG.

How to compile
--------------

Get the git version of FIPS openssl
git clone git://git.openssl.org/openssl.git
cd openssl
git branch fips 4089bd6080d41450adab1e0ac0d63cfeab4a78e7
git checkout fips
git am ../0001-Test-enable-debugging-include-bn-functions-in-FIPS-b.patch

./config fipscanisteronly
make

If there's something that doesn't compile here... good luck. Do not attempt compiling regular libcrypto together with FIPS, it's not going to work.

cd ..
make
./dual_ec_drbg_poc
